        "description": "We host a variety of technical and non-technical workshops to provide students the out-of-classroom technical and professional skills necessary to advance their education and career. Ever wondered           how to use the Linux command line? Interested in Python or making cool websites for your hackathon projects? Need some tips on how to spice up your resume? Then come out to our workshops and learn how! For many of our successful workshops, we have also teamed up with other student organizations, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS), and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). So if you are interested, join our mailing list or come to one of our meetings! Despite our name, we are open to all majors and welcoming to great ideas!"

        "description": "Besides our line of workshops, we also run four long-term project groups. These projects emphasize teamwork and require some time dedicated every week. However, they are also are an opportunity to contribute to a large-scale project outside of the classroom. You will also be able to showcase these projects to the School of Engineering and other students many times during the year and even compete against other schools. For this upcoming fall, we have four project groups running: Robotics, Quadcopter, Machine Learning, and Intelligent Sensor Networks. Please check out the pages for each project group if you are interested!"
